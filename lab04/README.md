# Course Task: Memory-Efficient Transformer Training Techniques

## Objective
The goal of this assignment is to **compare several modern memory-optimization techniques** used during Transformer training.  
Using the *same dataset*, *same model architecture*, and *same hyperparameters* (except for memory-related settings), your task is to measure and analyze how different optimization techniques influence:

- GPU memory usage  
- Maximum batch size that fits into memory  
- Training speed (time per step and total time for 1 epoch)  
- Final model performance (perplexity after 1 epoch)  

You will implement **four training regimes**:

1. **Baseline with TF32 + BF16 mixed precision**
2. **FlashAttention** (you can use FlashAttention 2)
3. **Windowed (local) attention**
4. **Gradient checkpointing**
5. (Optional) **Grouped KV attention**

Use the **same model checkpoint**, **same tokenizer**, **same dataset**, and **same training loop** structure for each experiment.

---

## Techniques to Compare

### 0. Full precision training (baseline)
- use full precision (FP/TF32) for model training
- define the largest batch size that fits into memory

If the batch size is very small, or does not fit into memory even for BS=1, reduce the model size: 
- number of layers,
- sequence length,
- hidden dimension.

It should be implemented **before** the other techniques. 
Observe the memory consumption and make sure the largest batch size is used.

### 1. BF16 Automatic Mixed Precision
Use `torch.cuda.amp.autocast(dtype=torch.bfloat16)`

This is the first optimization. 
* Run the experiment with the same settings as in the baseline and measure the memory consumption.
* Compare the final perplexity after 1 epoch.
* Repeat the experiment with the largest batch size possible, compare the final perplexity and training time.

### 2. FlashAttention
Replace the default attention mechanism with **FlashAttention** (v2 preferred, v1 acceptable).

You should use the flash-attn library. Check the documentation, to reduce the installation time.
Run the same experiments as with BF16. Take into account that FA only supports automatic BF16 mixed precision.

### 3. Windowed (Local) Attention
Replace full self-attention with sliding-window attention. Use the implementation provided by `flash-attn`.

Requirements:
- Window size must be configurable
- Model architecture should stay otherwise identical

Repeat the same experiments as in setup 1.
Measure the trade-off between memory reduction and degradation of perplexity.

### 4. Gradient Checkpointing
Enable:

```python
model.gradient_checkpointing_enable()
```
Measure memory savings and increased computation time. 
Repeat the same experiments as in setup 1.

### Dataset

Use the same dataset as in the 1st assignment.

### Model

Use the model from the 1st assignment.

## Measurements & Tools
### Memory Profiling

Use:
* PyTorch Memory Profiler

For each technique, record memory usage during:
* Forward pass of a single batch
* Backward pass
* Peak memory for one training step

Important:
For each experiment, increase batch size until OOM to find the maximum possible batch size that fits.

## Training Time

For each regime:
* measure seconds per step (mean over 20 steps)
* measure total training time for 1 epoch

## Final Perplexity

After one epoch:
* compute perplexity on a held-out validation set
* Use identical evaluation settings across experiments.

## Deliverables
### Code

Submit scripts or notebooks containing:
* Model definition
* Training loop

Separate configuration toggles for:
* bf16 mixed precision
* flash attention
* windowed attention
* gradient checkpointing
* memory profiling code
* evaluation code (perplexity)

### Report (4–6 pages)

Your report must include:
* Experimental Setup
* Dataset description
* Model architecture
* Hyperparameters
* Hardware used (GPU type, memory)
* Results Tables

For each technique include:

* Maximum batch size fitting into memory
* Peak memory usage
* Step time (forward + backward)
* Total epoch time
* Final perplexity
* Present results in clear comparison tables.

## Analysis & Discussion

Discuss:
* Why some techniques reduce memory more effectively
* Why some techniques slow down training
* The trade-off between memory, speed, and perplexity
* Whether combining techniques would help (optional)

Provide interpretations and not just raw numbers.
